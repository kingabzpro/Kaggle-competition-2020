## Introduction
In the past decade, computer science has evolved and the importance of Data Science has become the new norm, every company s looking to invest more in Machine learning. This is where someone like me who never had an Interest before got curious and started learning more about this world of Kaggle, it took me 3 months to get hold of some of the basic and advanced tools used by Data Scientists. I am using those same tools to evaluate this data set and come up with the best conclusion. In this Notebook, I will be telling you the story of data and I will be sharing my own experience so that any beginner can learn from my mistake and get ahead.

## Big Question
The big question is how do we determine whether getting a degree is necessary for getting into Data Science and eventually scoring Data Science Job. My sole focus will be on survey participants who had no formal degree and comparing them with other participants. In my opinion degree, the online platform has improved and due to COVID19, people get their skills through the online platform such as Kaggle, Udacity, DataCamp, edx, DataQuest, Udemy, Codecademy, and Coursera. These platforms are beginner friendly and it has paved the way for the less privileged people to get skills free. The ost COVID19 era will look different as more people will learn online.
